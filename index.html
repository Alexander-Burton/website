    <p>As an enthusiastic worker with a passion for learning, I am looking for rewarding employment that has the
        prospect of future growth and development. With 4 years’ experience as a Studio Assistant at Candle Bark
        Creations, I am equipped with strong administrative and communication skills as well as a team focused
        mentality. My time at Macquarie University, where I graduated with a Masters of Research in Biology, provided
        the foundation of knowledge which I have been building upon as a current Graduate Diploma of Data Science
        student.
        With my can-do attitude and motivation for continual learning and improvement, I look forward to contributing my
        skills and experience in any and all future roles I engage in.</p>
